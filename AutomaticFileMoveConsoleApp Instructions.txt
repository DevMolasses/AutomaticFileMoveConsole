AutomaticFileMoveConsoleApp.exe
   1. Copy the app to the desktop of the Gateway
   2. Double-Click the app to launch
   3. Input the full path for the Source Directory
      a.   Manually - Type the source path for the file type you want to move.  This is desired 
	   because you won't have to wait for the Gateway to load a lot of files
         i. Time Series Path - D:\siNetNode\TimeSeries
        ii. Tag Log Task Path - D:\siNetNode\LogTasks\TagLogTask
      b. Copy-Paste Method
         i. Use Start->Computer to open a windows explorer window
        ii. Navigate to the desired folder
       iii. Click in the field at the top of the window that shows the folder path.  This 
	    should convert the images in the field to text and automatically select the text.
        iv. Copy with Ctrl+C
         v. In the AutomaticFileMoveConsoleApp window, right-click on the title bar and 
	    select Edit->Paste
   4. Press enter
   5. Input the full path for the Destination Directory
      a. This may be easier using the Copy-Paste method described in step 3.b because the 
         directory for a drive shared over Remote Desktop Connection is not normal.
   6. Press Enter
   7. At this point the program takes over.  It will move all of the files in the Source Folder to the 
      Destination Folder without any more intervention.
      a. Make sure to leave the Remote Desktop Connection active.  If you don't the program 
	 will error out because it won't be able to find the shared drive.
      b. The app will display the files that are being transferred so you can see the progress.
      c. At any point if you need to cancel the moving operation, press Ctrl+C.  This will stop the 
	 execution and close the app.  Note that any files moved prior to cancellation will still be 
	 in the destination directory.
   8. When the program is complete it will instruct you to press enter to close the app.
   9. If additional directories need to be moved, repeat steps 2 - 9.
